# Tampa Development Coordination Locations - Datasette

The city of Tampa offers a map of [Development Coordination](https://tampa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=bbda3ba918ad420fa686db9656c32b76) applications. Maps are great however they are not as accessible as text. Coupled with frustrations in not being able to keep up with potential developments in my own neighborhood and listening to neighborhood leaders frustrated with similar issues, I set about finding the source of the data on the map. Through some back and forth with Technology & Innovation and some greatly appreciated work by the GIS team, the data was made [public](https://city-tampa.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/tampa::development-coordination-locations/explore?location=28.012561%2C-82.417200%2C11.84) last year.
